### About

Spring boot application to return loaded resources from a csv file located in the resource folder called data.csv

The maybe primary goal was to return a image resource in the request to and end point `GET http://localhost:8080/v1/api/image/{{name}}/{{surname}}`


Bases on the requirements , this can only return the resource not as a link as much as.


Set up :
- Requires java 11+ ,but thus was tested with JDK 17 ;
- Use intelli j to test its easier that way but you can use other IDEs
